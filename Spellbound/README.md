## 🌟 Why I Built This  
Language is full of hidden patterns that we never pause to admire.  
Spellbound was created as a **celebration of words**, turning the quirks of English into a visual and interactive playground.  

This project helped me explore:  
- creative UI design  
- 3D CSS animations  
- dynamic data display  
- user-friendly search & filtering  
- content-rich React components  

It’s one of my most *joyful* builds — part dictionary, part game, part art.
